# Simple-Responsive-landing-page
A simple responsive landing page is a one-page website designed to introduce a product, service, or event in a clean and engaging manner. It’s responsive, meaning it adapts seamlessly across all devices — desktops, tablets, and mobile phones — by using flexible layouts, images, and CSS media queries.

Key elements typically include:
A header with a logo and navigation links

A hero section with a catchy headline, short description, and a call-to-action (CTA) button

A features or benefits section using a grid or flexbox for easy responsiveness

A responsive layout that adjusts to different screen sizes using CSS techniques like flexbox or CSS Grid

A footer with contact details and social media links

This design prioritizes speed, usability, and accessibility, allowing visitors to quickly understand the purpose and navigate easily on any device.![Screenshot 2025-06-23 220210](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c3a8f99d-24e5-4cbc-b473-86472f0c6de6)
